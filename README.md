## Running the frontend

- Clone git UI submodule

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

- Install Live Server extension if you don't have it from [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) on VSCode Quick Open (`Ctrl + P`)

```bash
ext install ritwickdey.LiveServer
```

- To run the frontend, start `ui/index.html` file with Live Server (Right click `Open with Live Server`)

- **Important Note** You have to open vscode in the root folder of the project.

- **To avoid CORS errors** start the backend before the frontend, some browsers have CORS issues otherwise

### Testing the backend

- Make sure that you have `pytest` installed

- Run the test command

```bash
python3 manage.py test
```
